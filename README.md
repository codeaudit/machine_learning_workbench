```ruby
gem 'machine_learning_workbench'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install machine_learning_workbench

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
